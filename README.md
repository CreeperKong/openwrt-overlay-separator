# openwrt-overlay-separator

CURRENTLY WORK IN PROGRESS! Use for test only!

## Target
On some devices which have easy direct access to its storage devices like x86 and single board computers, it is better to have a separate partition for /overlay when running on squashfs /rom. Because they usually donâ€™t have limitations for storage space. This can help combine the ease of squashfs and easy to manage.
